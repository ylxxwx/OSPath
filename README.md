All my study is based on the two projects above.
cfenollosa/os-tutorial is a very good study material for OS learning. It builds the OS step by step so we can easily learn the OS piece by piece.
The reason I want to clone from cfenollosa and change it is to run it in my Ubuntu environement.
And I added support for GRUB and run/debug it with bochs.
